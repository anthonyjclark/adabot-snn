  abstract = {The Evolutionary Robotics process requires the evaluation of large numbers of robot controllers in order to determine their relative fitnesses. The evaluation of many controllers is typically performed in simulation instead of real-world hardware in order to speed up the evolutionary process and avoid damage to robot hardware. Physics-based simulators are traditionally used in robotics for evaluating controllers. Effective traditional simulators may require a high level of accuracy and their creation requires specialised knowledge of the dynamics of the robotic system. Alternatively Artificial Neural Network based simulators are relatively simple to construct, are highly accurate, efficient and assume little specialised knowledge of the dynamics involved. This paper proposes a novel controller evolution method that integrates uncertainty information from an ensemble of Artificial Neural Network based simulators. By estimating the accuracy of simulator predictions during the controller evolution process, robot behaviours that are not accurately simulated are likely to be avoided. A performance comparison of a single versus ensembles configuration of Artificial Neural Network based simulators is investigated. The ensemble approach developed in this work has so far outperformed all prior controller evolution methods investigated for the presented problem.},

  doi = {10.1109/ICIST.2018.8426142},
  abstract = {Inverse kinematics refers to determining the forces that must be applied to a particular system to result in a desired configuration of the system. In robotics, inverse kinematics means calculating the robot actuator movements necessary to make a robot perform a specific task. Calculating the inverse kinematics using traditional methods is a complex and time consuming task. This paper reports on a novel approach to predicting the inverse kinematics of a mobile robot using Neural Networks (NNs). The main advantage of using artificial intelligence to determine inverse kinematics is that minimal human input and intervention is required. This research makes use of Feedforward NNs to predict the motor velocities and the time that they must be maintained to make the robot reach a specified destination. Inertia and friction are automatically incorporated into the NN predictions. Experimental evidence is presented which shows that the proposed approach can successfully produce commands which allow the robot to traverse a given path.},

  abstract = {In our continuing quest for knowledge, robots are powerful tools for accessing environments too dangerous or too remote for human exploration. Early systems functioned under close human supervision, effectively limited to executing preprogrammed tasks. However, as exploration moves to regions where communication is ineffective or unviable, robots will need to carry out complex tasks without human supervision. To enable such capabilities, robots are being enhanced by advances ranging from new sensor development to automated mission planning software, distributed robotic control, and more efficient power systems. As robotics technology becomes simultaneously more capable and economically viable, individual robots operated at large expense by teams of experts are increasingly supplemented by teams of robots used cooperatively under minimal human supervision.},

  doi = {10.1109/SSCI.2017.8280873},
  abstract = {The vehicle routing problem is a well-researched problem with various solutions. Although this problem has been solved many times, there is rarely a case where a solution covers a real-life situation completely. In this paper, a particular dynamic vehicle routing problem is being analyzed. It consists of rescue path planning independently flying drones or driving vehicles in a disaster simulation. The scenario includes continuous updates of injured people that need to be picked up by rescue drones, limited operation range, prioritization of the pickup order depending on the injury level, and a number of people at a certain rescue location. This paper discusses how the dynamic vehicle routing problem can be broken down into a set of static vehicle routing problems. Those problems are then optimized with the help of a particular ant algorithm - in this particular case, an adapted Ant Colony System (ACS). This paper discusses the modelling of the rescue problem as a particular vehicle routing problem and the adaptation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to solve it.},
